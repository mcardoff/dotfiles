* Deploy script
Here is a list of what I have to do for the deploy script
- [X] Move =.emacs.d= to =.config/emacs=
- [X] Delete Old Profiles
- [ ] Fix Deploy script to just do =.config/emacs=
* Setup
There are a few things that need to be done besides what is done in the deploy script
- Create =~/.authinfo.gpg= and necessary gpg keys
- Installing the =Source Code Pro= Font 
* Notes
For my git config, if you do not already have one, it will simply copy mine, you will need to change it
* Programs I Use
- =alacritty= terminal, but I also toy with =xterm= and =kitty=
- =bashtop= for process monitoring
- =dmenu= my build of it recommended
- =emacs= for my main text editor
- =firefox= or =chromium= for a web browser
- =git= duh?
- =kakoune= for a terminal based text editor, I am working on a vim config however
- =pcmanfm= if a more modern FM is more your style
- =ranger= for a terminal based FM
- =thunderbird= for desktop email
- =xmonad= with =xmonad-contrib= and =xmobar= or =i3= for a WM
  - Part of my scripts uses the =i3lock= program, as well as =scrot= and =imagemagick=
- =zsh= shell
- =discord=, specifically =discord-canary= is used in my config
- =slack= and =mattermost= for professional communications
