\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{Question}
Why did the Framers set up such a complex and difficult process for
legislation to become law, and what have been the positive and
negative consequences?
\subsection*{Answer}
\par
The Framers of the Constitution did not want it to be easy for things
to change in the US, so they set up a very complex process for
legislation to become law. They wanted to prevent any drastic changes
from being put through to law too quickly. Coming from a monarchy as
well, they wanted to avoid a tyrannical government such as the one
they came from. This process, while ensuring checks and balances on
each branch of government, has shown its especially in recent,
regarding the current actions of Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell.
\par
The Framers intentions when making such a complex system of turning
legislation into law was for a few reasons. Mainly, they wanted to
ensure that the status quo was maintained and that the government was
kept in check and so that no tyrannical government would rise. It is
very effective in doing both of these, due to the many roadblacks
which the legislature faces on it way to becoming a law. The classic
legislative process has the bill starting in either house of Congress
but it must be approved by both before it even gets a chance to be a
law. Even after that, the Executive Branch in the form of the
President, must check on the legislature and sign on it. After this,
it still must be deemed constitutional by the courts (Krutz et al.,
436). This does not even mention much of modern legislation, which
involves committees and much more discussion of the intricacies of the
bill such as its cost, amending, and much more. These ensure checks
and balances as at every stage of the bill's 'life' there are points
where it can be removed by another branch of the government. Since
this process has so many steps, there is a guarantee that no spur of
the moment decisions will be made based on small changes in the
current environment. By the time it came for the other House of
Congress to vote on the legislation, those conditions will have worn
out, and it will no longer be necessary. That is even if it makes it
out of the first House of Congress in the first place. While this is a
big strength of our legislature system, there are some steps which
lead to a rather stagnant government.
\par
One main weakness that can be seen in the legislative process is to
ignore it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a lot of bills
which were passed by the House of Representatives and he has yet to
present to the Senate. It is his job to present these bills to the
senate body, yet he has not. On one hand, he is ensuring that these
bills were not too hastily passed by the House, but on the other hand,
some of these bills have been on his desk for quite a long time, so
there has been plenty of time for the conditions to die down, so why
not place these bills on the floor to get voted down? Since the House
is currently majority Democrat, it points to a partisan issue rather
than an issue of passing legislation. This is not good, essentially
placing a brick wall on all legislation coming from House Democrats,
so truly nothing can get done on their part. The weakness that emerges
is less with the actual implementation by the Framers, but rather with
its practice especially in the emergence of a partisan system.
However, this must be taken further, is this not just another form of
fillibuster? The problem with seeing these actions as a form of
fillibuster is that it is not the lesser represented party preventing
the larger from passing their own legislation, it is the other way
around, which is dangerous for a system which heavily relies on the
smaller power being able to pass its own legislation. 

\section*{Question 2}
\subsection*{Question}
What are the opportunities and limitation for presidential leadership
in the contemporary US political system?
\subsection*{Answer}
The Framers of the Constitution initially gave the President very few
powers, afraid that they would be too much like a king, which they
desperately wanted to avoid (Krutz et al., 447). Over the years
however, the president has had many more opportunities to increase its
leadership. The increase in the size and influence of the position of
the president comes from various international problems.  These
problems have lead to the office of the president to become more
involved in all aspects of politics, national and international.
\par
The president is seen as in to the World as the figurehead of United
States politics. This means that much of international relations is
headed by the President. This can be traced all the way back to when
George Washington's Cabinet issued a statement of neutrality in 1793,
proclaiming that the US would be neutral in the current European
conflict between France and England. The president did this despite
any declarations of war needing to originate from the House. Many
other wartimes are when we see President's extend their power in this
way. The position of the president as the Commander-in-Chief of the US
Army has led to much of this misuse of power.
\par
There still are limitations to the President's powers, most of which
were been defined in the Constitution. More specifically, Congress has
the power to impeach the President if they find him/her unfit to the
position. This was seen most recently when Donald Trump was impeached
by the House of Representatives. Before this, both Bill Clinton and
Andrew Johnson have been impeached (Krutx et al., 227). However,
none of these cases have led to the President being removed from
office, so this seems to be quite a weak limitation. 
\section*{Question 3}
\subsection*{Question}
In what ways is the U.S. court system better suited to protect the individual than
are the other branches of the government?
\subsection*{Answer}
The courts more often than not, will deal directly with
individuals. When you hear about landmark achievements by the supreme
court, you will hear the names of the people (i.e. Marbury and
Madison) rather than the name of a bill (i.e. Civil Rights Act of
1964)(Krutz et al., 488). The conditions on which Supreme Court
Justices are chosen are very different than elected officials, and the
course of their careers vary as well. These reasons together provide a
much different dynamic when looking at the law of the US.
\par
The court system will quite literally deal with the people. This
allows for the courts to hear the issues that people have directly as
opposed to hearing in the form of public outcry that elected officials
might have to do. With the structure of the courts which we have, if a
case is able to reach the Supreme Court, then there is some major form
of problem which requires an in-depth look at the laws presented by
the Constitution.
\par
The life-long term of a Supreme Court Justice completely removes the
worry of re-election that some elected officials will have. This
encourages the Justices to take on more definitive stances that will
result in the betterment of the condition of the people, rather than
having to appeal to a party, or even the people themselves. Take the
decision from Brown v. Board (1954), despite segregation existing in
many of the Southern States, the courts had deemed that separate but
equal was inherently inequal (Krutz et al., 1954).
