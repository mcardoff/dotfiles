\maketitle
The article in question is an exerpt from the Journal of Family Theory
\& Review, Vol. 11, specifically Issue 3, which is on pages 412-428, it
was published in September of 2019. This article mainly focuses on the
family culture and "minority myth" stereotype of Asian Americans. The
authors intend to show that there is much more nuance to the way which
Asian Americans integrate themselves than at first looks. The author
argues that Asian Americans are not one monolithic culture that
experience the exact same path. The general stereotype is that Asian
Americans tend to be very successful when they immigrate to the United
States, they will be at the top in terms of education, salary, and
other areas. The authors find this to be completely untrue, more
specifically that the Asian American immigrant is much more diverse in
their experience in the US. 
\par
The authors are criticizing is the general view that Asian Americans
are in general more successful than other immigrant groups. This has
led to a broader general assumption that these immigrants do not face
discrimination. This comes from the fact that Asian Americans often
seem more likely to rise to the "same" social and economic status as
white people living in the US, so the discrimination which other
groups see are simply not present for Asian Americans. This is cited
as the elite minority myth. The authors counter this by citing the
sheer diversity in the Asian American population.
\par
The term Asian American refers to a population of over 30 subgroups,
which all together make up 6.4\% of the countries population. The
problem with this is that grouping all these people together makes
their experiences seem similar. This is obviously not the case, the
paper finds that there is as much diversity in Asian American
immigration than in any other group. This is particularly problematic
when it comes to research. Or at least it would be, if any research
was done. The author states that because of the myth of their success
and the general lumping together of all Asian Americans, there is
little research done in this group.
\par
This article is very strong when it comes to comparing its new ideas
to ideas of the past. Particularly the contrasting of William
Petersen's work with modern theory. The Petersen article praises
Japanese-Americans for overcoming the "adversity of their World War II
incarceration" in 20 years. This was shown to directly conflict with a
report by the Department of Labor in the 1960s, as both articles
(Petersen and the DoL) cite the same reasons for Asian American Sucess
and African American failure. The authors connect this to the
possibility that racism does not exist in America. The authors state
that the emphasis on the model minority stereotype was simply
constructed by the White Elite. This status as simply an elite
minority rather than a true American citizen prevents members of this
group from truly feeling like a member of the American
population, instead making them feel more a member of a group they had
left, more Asian than American. 
\par
One idea that runs throughout the paper which is quite strong is the
idea of intersectional study. Since the group of Asian Americans
composes of so many groups, there are bound to be statistical errors
in looking at such a large group. The authors cite a myriad of
demographic data which shows the diversity in Asian ethnic groups. The
authors use disaggregated data (opposed to aggregated data) to show
the different trends for the various subgroups under the umbrella of
Asian American. The authors look at higher education, employment,
Household income, and Poverty. They find that many stereotypes of the
Asian Americans do not apply to all of these subgroups. Taking
education for example, when looking at the aggregate (all groups),
about 50\% percent of Asian Americans have a Bachelor degree. However,
looking at the individual groups, they find that over 70\% of
Taiwanese and Asian Indians have Bachelor's Degrees, while on the
lower end, less than 15\% of Laotians and Bhutanese have this higher
education. The emphasis on a statistical argument against the model
minority myth aids the authors greatly.
\par
An interesting point the author makes in the beginning of the article
is that by 2055, Asian Americans are expected to become the largest
immigrant group in the US (Shih, et al.,412). This point is not used
much beyond its initial statement. I can understand why this would be
true, it is surprising that the authors never mention population
statistics much more. It seems that with their argument, it would make
sense to provide an updated stat. This would possibly show that there
would indeed be a large population of a few different Asian
Immigrants, but that one group would not dominate completely. This is
hardly a weakness and more of a nitpick, but it would still be nice to
see.
\par
This article was very interesting, and most definitely kept my
attention. Especially the discussions over the particular statistics
of groups when it came to gender. I found it interesting that Asian
American women made the most money out of any minority group, and even
then they only made 83 cents to the white man's dollar (Shih, et al.,
417). The authors' argument tended to be very modern. I found the
specific examples of Petersen and Moynihan to be helpful in
demonstrating why the posing of Asian Americans as an ideal is more
harmful than good.
\par
The only time the article really annoyed me is in the discussion about
Petersen. It almost romanticizes the hardships of the Japanese
Americans, it paints the struggles of these people as if it is some
fairy tale which got magically poofed away after World War II. As if
that was not bad enough, it was used to push a racist agenda that was
applied to all Asian Americans, which is simply nonsense. To see this
again 

% model minority mean we racist
% People who do not have upward mobility its their fault, when it is
% systemic
% gender only analyzes women
