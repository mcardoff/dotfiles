   There are many ways to take this. You could totally blame the electors, when
   it comes down to it they are the people who put the president in
   office. However, even if the president is unfavorable to the people, they
   should still be able to uphold their duty as president of the United States,
   so maybe it is the actual occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. which is the
   problem. Despite this, the office which that person has agreed to fill is
   much bigger than any person could possibly fill. You said it best in your
   slides, we have simply created a position of the presidency which only a
   superhuman could fill. The presidency is essentially bloated with powers that
   it was not originally given by the constitution. The solution to this would
   be to absolve some of these powers. The problem found with this would be
   determining which of these powers are suitable for removal. I would think an
   good start would have to be war powers. The president May be the Commander in
   Chief, but he should have to direct troops, not declare when and where to
   send them, it should be returned as the SOLE power of Congress.

   The Judicial Branch has very large reach, and in terms of civil
   rights. Even if Congress passes a bill﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ regarding civil rights, it
   seems that it always takes a supreme court case in order for all
   (probably most) of the states to begin changes to obey that. Gay
   marriage for example was a court case in the US, finding that
   limiting marriage between two people is unconstitutional. A
   weakness of this argument is the existence of so many court cases
   and bills alike which have to do with race. For example, Brown
   v. Board claimed that segregation of black and white people was
   unconstitutional. Even still, in 1964, many African American
   Students were stil in segragated school, and there was still
   segregation in other areas, necessitating the Civil Rights act of
   1964.
