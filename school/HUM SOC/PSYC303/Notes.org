   Notes on: Assessment and diagnosis of Psychopathology
*** Clinical Assessment
    - Patient can't concentrate
    - A lot of mental disorders and neurological problems result in
      loss of concentration
    - You have to perform a medical assessment
    - Assessing Psychological Disorders
      - Clinical assessment :: The systematic evaluation measurement
           of psychological, biological, and social/culutural factors
           in an individual
      - Purposes ::
	- Understand individual they need, bio, psyc, etc
	- Predict behavior
	- Plan treatment
	- Evaluate outcome of treatment, includes type of treatment
          they need, bio, psyc, etc
      - Key concepts in assessment:
	1. Reliability
	   - Consistency in measurement
	   - Examples :: Test-retest, and inter-rater
	     - If raters are reliable, then the results should permeate
               through time
	2. Validity
	   - What an assessment approach measures and how well it does so
	   - How well tests compare to other tests in terms of results
	   - Examples :: Concurrent and predictive validity
	     - SAT has predictive validity for college
	3. Standardization
	   - Ensures consistency in the use of a technique
	   - Prdovides population benchmarks for comparison
	   - Examples :: Structured administration, scoring and
                  evaluation procedures
	     - Should be compared with people like you
      - Sources of Information for Clinical Assessment
	1. Clinical Interviews
	   1. Primary technique for gathering data and making
              decisions
	   2. Used to elicit data, information, beliefs or
              attitudes
	   3. Characteristics ::
	      - Interaction
		- Initiated with a goal in mind
		- One-sided (?)
	      - Interviews vs. Tests

		- Method ::
		  - Convery understanding
		  - Projecting a calm and confident demeanor
	      - Diagnostic interview
		- Purpose ::
		  - Arrive at a DSM diagnostiv formulation
		  - Can be structured or unstructured
		  - Structured ::
		    - Standard set of questions asked in sequence
		    - No deviation from the set order
		    - Advantages :: Consistency and breadth
		    - Weaknesses :: Rigid, Lenghty, depth and interviewer may drift from it
		    - Example :: Diagnostic Interview Schedule

		    - Advantages :: Flexibility, depth, and rapport
		    - Weaknessess :: Least consistent,
                       breadth, there is a problem of
                       validity and bias
		  - Semi-Structured ::
		    - Standard questions asked in a sequence
		    - Allows for deviation
		    - Necessary to have constant responses from patient
		    - Combines flexibility of unstructured with consistency of structured
		    - Balances breadth and depth

   - Reasearch in Psychopathology
   - Questions driving a science of psychopathology
     - What problems distress or impair function?
     - Why do people behave abnormally?
     - How can we help people behave in more adaptive ways?
   - Basic Components of Research
     - Start with atheoretical hypothesis
       - Not all testable
       - Science formulates testable hypotheses
	 - Does use of MDMA over a period of 1 year lead to a decrease in cognitive performance
	   - Testable
	 - Is MDMA good for your brain?
	   - Not testable
     - Research Design
       - Method to test hypotheses
       - Variable: opposite of a constant, can take different values
	 - Independent : Variable that causes or influences behavior
	 - Dependent : The change influenced by the independent variable
       - Considerations:
	 - Internal validity : The extent to which the results can be attributed to the independent
           variable
	 - External validity : The extent to which the results can be generalized or applied
           outside the study
	 - Confounds : Uncontrolled variables that influence the results of the study
	 - Ways to increase internal validity by minimizing confounds:
	   - Use of Control Groups
	   - Random assignment procedures
	   - Use of analog models
	 - Relation between internal and external validity
	   - Need balance between the two
	   - Cant have perfect both
       - Statistical vs. Clinical Significance
	 - Stats methods help protect against biases in evaluation of data
	 - Statistical Significance
	   - The mathematical calculation of the difference between groups
	 - Clinical significance
	   - Whether or not that difference was meaningful
	 - Statistical significance does not imply clinical meaningfulness
       - Types of Research Designs
	 - Case Study
	   - Extensive observation and detailed description of an individual client
	   - Foundation of early historic developments in psychopathology
	   - Limitations

	   - The nature of correlation
	     - Relationship between two variables
	     - No independent variable is manipulated
	     - Provides an index of strength of the relation between vars and can be used to
               predict future behavior
	     - Useful when it is unethical or not possible to manipulate variables
	     - Correlation goes from -1 to 1
	       - 0 means no correlation
	       - -1 is perfect negative correlation
		 - One increases as teh other decreases
	       - 1 is perfect positive correlation
		 - One increases so does the other
	     - Abs value close to one is good
	   - Correlation does not imply causation
	   - Other limitations
	     - Cannot determine direction of causation
	       - Equally likely that A -> B as is B -> A
	     - Third variable
	       - Two correlated variables may be linked by a third
	   - Examples :: Epidemiological Research
	     - Incidence, prevalence, and course of disorders
	     - AIDs, trauma following disaster
	 - Experimental Research
	   - Independent variable manipulated in a controlled environment
	   - Establish causal relations
	   - Maximizes internal validity but limited external validity
	   - Group Experimental Designs

       - Value of research designs depends on the questions posed
       - Abnormal psyc is founded in scientific method
       - Replication is cornerstone of science and programmatic research
       - Research must occur in the context of ethical considerations and values
