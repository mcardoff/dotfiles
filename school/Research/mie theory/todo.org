** TODO Chnges to program
   - [X] Change number of points used
     - variable: npoints
   - [X] change particle size
     - variable: a or R
   - [X] change series terms
     - variable: nmax
   - [X] Change material to Nb
     - Involves interpolation, maybe try something else
** Tunneling Program Notes
   - Data is in specific formatted text file
     - Import from File -> Import Data
     - Import data to Statistics (C-i)
   - Right click on data file under analysis data
   - Click blank  plus
   - Open fit didv
     - CHANGE from BTK
     - SIS d-wave most often
       - Super interacting with super
     - SIN d-Wave as well
       - Super interacting with normal
   - Vmax sets x axis range
   - Do not put gamma to 0
   - Gamma increases height of peaks
   - Delta broadens width
   - Name : PCT Analysis v3
* Meeting on 21 Jul 202
** TODO Change Program
   - [ ] Change to Nb
     - Need to modify region of interpolation (in e1 and e2.csv)
   [[~/school/Research/mie%20theory/e1.csv][e1.csv]]
   [[~/school/Research/mie%20theory/e2.csv][e2.csv]]
   - [ ] Change range to 2->8 eV
   - [ ] Find out about comsol
